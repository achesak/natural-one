# About Natural One

Natural One is a dice roller designed primarily for the Pathfinder tabletop roll-playing game, though
it is of course usable as a general purpose dice roller.

In addition to basic dice roller features, Natural One also includes stats for weapons in multiple game
systems. While the primary focus is on Pathfinder, there is also support for Starfinder, D&D 3.5e, D&D 4e,
and D&D 5e. New game systems can be easily added as well.

The template feature makes larger, more complex rolls much easier. Don't want to roll base damage,
elemental damage, and sneak attacks every turn? Simply enter these in as a template and roll them all
at once. Templates are very configurable, allowing them to be used for whatever rolls are required.

An initiative tracker helps DMs with managing combat sessions. Initiatives can either be rolled or added
directly, with automatic sorting and drag and drop to reorder as needed.

# Using Natural One

Natural One requires the Python interpreter to run. Development is done using 2.7.x, but it should work
with 3.x as well. GTK+ 3 and its Python bindings are also required. 

To run Natural One, open a terminal in the directory containing the files and type `python naturalone.py`.
On some systems double-clicking on the `naturalone.py` file will also work.

Natural One has only been tested on Linux.
